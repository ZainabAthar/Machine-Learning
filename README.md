## Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository of machine learning projects! Here, I explore various analytics and machine learning techniques on real-life datasets across different domains.

### 1. Real Estate Market Analysis

In this project, I delve into the dynamics of the real estate market using a dataset of homes for sale. The main objective was to uncover potential regional differences in the market.

**Technologies Used:**
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

### 2. Apartment Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a predictive model for estimating the prices of apartments, particularly those priced below $100,000.

**Technologies Used:**
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Seaborn
- One Hot Encoder
- Simple Imputer
- Linear Regression & Ridge Regression
